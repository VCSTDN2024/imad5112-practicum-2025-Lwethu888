 Project Overview
The Song Playlist is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the IMAD module. This application was created using the programming language **Kotlin** and Android Studio. The app's primary purpose is to improve problem-solving skills.

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

Purpose:
The main goal is to organize and deliver a personalized listening experience by allowing users to create custom playlists that reflect their taste or current mood.


### Key Features:
- Users can view a list of added songs along with details like title and artist,
- Each song can be rated on a scale of 1 to 5, helping users express preferences and filter top-rated tracks. 
- Users can leave brief comments or notes on each song.
- The view and exit help users interact with the playlist easily.
 
The aim is to provide users with a convenient and personalized way to organize, store, and enjoy their favorite songs. 

## Design Consideration
The design of the Song Playlist was based on the following key considerations:

1. User Experience: The app was designed with the goal of providing an instinctive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. Responsiveness: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. Simplicity: The design is simple, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.

4. Performance: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.

 GitHub and GitHub Actions
This project was managed using GitHub for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled safe coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project honor.

 GitHub Actions:
I utilized GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process. 

This includes:
- Running automated tests to ensure the app is functional.
- Compiling the app into APK  and  AAB files, which are the formats required for the app’s distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.
The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push any changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

- This section educates students on why they should understand GitHub version control and automation (GitHub Actions). It shows how they’re adopting industry-standard practices, which is useful for both academic purposes and career development.

## Challenges and Learnings
During the development of this project, I encountered a few challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: I had issues with identifying and resolving errors. 
   - **Solution**:  I asked a developer for assistance.
   
2. **Challenge 2**: I had issues with running the app.
   - **Solution**: I went to YouTube and searched another way of running the app.
     
From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

## Future Enhancements
While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. Feature 1: Add filters to show only 5-star songs or songs with comments. 
2. Feature 2: Allow users to share their playlists with others via link or QR code.
3. Feature 3: If you don’t know the name of the song or its lyrics, you can hum the tune to find it.

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for the end user.
